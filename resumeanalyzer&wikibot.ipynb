            "\n",
            "**Overall Strengths:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Strong academic record and GPA.\n",
            "* Good list of laboratory skills relevant to biotechnology.\n",
            "* Several awards and recognitions showcasing achievement.\n",
            "* Involvement in extracurricular activities and leadership roles.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Overall Weaknesses:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Formatting inconsistencies and lack of visual appeal.\n",
            "* \"About Me\" section is too generic and doesn't highlight unique value.\n",
            "*  Doesn't quantify accomplishments or provide context for achievements.\n",
            "*  Workshops listed separately instead of integrated into experience or skills sections.\n",
            "*  No mention of specific career goals or desired roles.\n",
            "* ATS friendliness needs improvement.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Formatting and Content:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Use a professional resume template:** This will improve readability and visual appeal. Choose a clean, modern template.\n",
            "* **Consistent Formatting:** Use consistent font sizes, bolding, and spacing throughout.  Dates should be aligned consistently.\n",
            "* **Reverse Chronological Order:** List education and experiences in reverse chronological order (most recent first).\n",
            "* **Quantify Achievements:** Instead of just listing accomplishments, quantify them whenever possible. For example, instead of \"Technical Events Head,\" say \"Technical Events Head, overseeing logistics for 10+ events with 500+ attendees.\"\n",
            "* **Add a \"Skills\" Section:** Consolidate all technical and soft skills into a dedicated \"Skills\" section. This makes it easier for ATS to parse.\n",
            "* **Tailor to Specific Roles:**  Customize the resume for each job application, highlighting the skills and experiences most relevant to the target role.\n",
            "* **Keywords:** Research relevant keywords for the desired roles and incorporate them naturally throughout the resume.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Specific Areas to Add/Remove:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Remove \"About Me\":** Replace with a concise and compelling \"Summary/Objective\" statement that highlights career goals and key skills.  Focus on what you can offer a potential employer.\n",
            "* **Add a \"Projects\" Section:** If you've completed any significant academic projects, create a separate section to showcase them. Include details about the project's objective, your contributions, and the outcomes.\n",
            "* **Integrate Workshops:** Instead of a separate \"Workshops\" section, incorporate relevant workshops into the \"Skills\" or \"Education\" sections.  Briefly mention the key skills gained.\n",
            "* **Expand on Leadership Roles:** Provide more detail about your responsibilities and achievements as Technical Events Head.\n",
            "* **Consider Adding a \"Relevant Coursework\" Section:** List relevant courses to further demonstrate your knowledge and skills.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tone, Clarity, and Grammar:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Stronger Action Verbs:**  Use more active and impactful verbs to describe your experiences (e.g., \"managed,\" \"developed,\" \"implemented,\" \"analyzed\").\n",
            "* **Conciseness:**  Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases.  Be direct and to the point.\n",
            "* **Proofread Carefully:** Ensure there are no grammatical errors or typos.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**ATS Friendliness Score (out of 10):** 4/10\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Reasons for low score:** Inconsistent formatting, lack of a dedicated skills section, use of tables or unusual formatting (likely implied by the original formatting).\n",
            "* **Improvements for ATS:** Use a standard font, avoid tables or columns, use clear section headings, and incorporate relevant keywords. Save the resume as a plain text (.txt) file to check for any hidden formatting that could confuse ATS.  Preferably use a PDF unless a specific format is requested.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Example of a revised Summary/Objective:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Highly motivated and results-oriented Industrial Biotechnology undergraduate (CGPA: 9.56) seeking a research internship in [Specific Area of Interest, e.g., genetic engineering].
